The `ctx` object is used in luz to share information between the training loop and callbacks, model methods and metrics. The table below describes information available in the `ctx` by default. Other callbacks could potentially modify these attributes or add new ones.

| Attribute        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `step`           | Closure that will be used to do one `step` of the model. It's used for both training and validation. Takes no argument, but can access the `ctx` object.                                             |
| `call_callbacks` | Call callbacks by name. For example `call_callbacks("on_train_begin")` will call all callbacks that provide methods for this point.                                                                  |

| `pred`           | Last predictions obtained by `ctx$model$forward` . **Note:** can be potentially modified by previously ran callbacks. Also note that this might not be available if you used a custom training step. |
| `loss`           | Last computed loss from the model. **Note:** this might not be available if you modified the training or validation step.                                                                            |
| `opt`            | Current optimizer, ie. optimizer that will be used to do the next `step` to update parameters.                                                                                                       |
| `opt_nm`         | Current optimizer name. By default it's `opt` , but can change if your model uses more than one optimizer depending on the set of parameters being optimized.                                        |
| `metrics`        | `list()` of metric objects that are `update`d at every `on_train_batch_end()` or `on_valid_batch_end()`. See also `help("luz_callback_metrics")`                                                     |
| `records`        | `list()` recording metric values for training and validation for each epoch. See also `help("luz_callback_metrics")`                                                                                 |
| `handlers`       | A named `list()` of handlers that is passed to `rlang::with_handlers()` during the training loop and can be used to handle errors or conditions that might be raised by other callbacks.             |
